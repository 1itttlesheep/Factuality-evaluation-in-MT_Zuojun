# Code for generating Checklist templates
Use [paws_para.txt](checklist_generate/paws_para.txt) to generate templates on paws dataset.
To generate templates on wmt dataset, unpack [news-commentary-v15.de-en.zip](checklist_generate/news-commentary-v15.de-en.zip) first, and run [direct_translate.py](checklist_generate/direct_translate.py). You will get a file called "desr.txt", which contains at each line a source text, original reference, a direct translated reference generated by code. All templates on wmt dataset need to be created on this file.

The texts used in the experiments are in the folder [adversarial text](checklist_generate/adversarial text/).
